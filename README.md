# pig_game# 
The game is played by 2 players; the first one to reach 100 points wins.
The game is simple: in each turn, the player can roll a die. The number rolled is added to the amount of points the player has obtained on the current turn. The player can keep rolling the die untill he rolls a 1 or he chooses to hold. If a 1 is rolled, the player looses all the points obtained on the current turn and a change of turn occurs. If the player chooses to hold, the points accumulated in the current turn are added to the total points of the player and a change of turn occurs.
